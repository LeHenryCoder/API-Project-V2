The reason in in the README file","","# Simple Python Banking API","","## Description","This project focuses on building a **Simple Python Banking API** using AWS Cloud9. Designed to simulate basic banking operations, it offers a platform for learning API development and cloud integration. Implemented in Python, it showcases the structure and development of a RESTful API for banking functions.","","## Key Features","- **Account Information Retrieval**: Fetch basic account details like account number, balance, and account type.","- **Transaction History**: View a list of recent banking transactions.","- **Simple and Scalable Design**: Maintains simplicity while being scalable for future enhancements.","","## Technologies Used","- **Python**: For API endpoints and business logic.","- **AWS Cloud9**: As the cloud-based IDE for development.","- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and source code management.","","## Learning Objectives","- Master RESTful API development in Python.","- Gain practical experience with AWS Cloud9.","- Explore version control with Git and GitHub.","","## Project Status","- **Current Phase**: Development","- **Contribution**: Open to contributions, suggestions, and feedback.","","## Lessons Learned in Version 1.0","In the initial version of this project, I encountered a couple of key issues that significantly impacted the project structure and my development experience:","","- **Incorrect Order of Resource Creation**: I created an EC2 instance before setting up a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). This led to a situation where the EC2 instance wasn't in the VPC, and that is a no no. I mean I could've tried to intertwine different VPC's together, but my brain would have actually exploded.","","- **Integration Challenges with GitHub**: I almost lost my mind trying to connect GitHub to AWS Cloud9. The process was pretty straight forward but I was eating food and watching a movie while I was connected my aws c9 environment to GitHub, so...... It ended up taking 3 hours...","","### Key Takeaways","- **Importance of VPC First Approach**: Starting with a VPC setup in AWS before provisioning other resources like EC2 instances ensures that all components of the project are correctly networked and secure from the outset.","- **Persistence in Problem-Solving**: The challenges with GitHub integration taught me the value of persistence and patience in troubleshooting and problem-solving in software development.","=======",""],"id":1,"ignore":true},{"start":{"row":53,"column":0},"end":{"row":54,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":[">>>>>>> feaabcb (setup)",""]}],[{"start":{"row":38,"column":0},"end":{"row":53,"column":23},"action":"remove","lines":["=======","         ___        ______     ____ _                 _  ___  ","        / \\ \\      / / ___|   / ___| | ___  _   _  __| |/ _ \\ ","       / _ \\ \\ /\\ / /\\___ \\  | |   | |/ _ \\| | | |/ _` | (_) |","      / ___ \\ V  V /  ___) | | |___| | (_) | |_| | (_| |\\__, |","     /_/   \\_\\_/\\_/  |____/   \\____|_|\\___/ \\__,_|\\__,_|  /_/ "," ----------------------------------------------------------------- ","","","Hi there!
